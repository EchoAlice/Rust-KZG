This repository is a place where I can document KZG-based concepts used to scale Ethereum.

I'm creating this cryptographic library to gain a deeper understanding of 
elliptic curve cryptography and Rust.

Ultimately, I'd like to expose all public-facing functions that're needed to implement full-scale Danksharding.

TODO: 
- Create `blob_to_kzg_commitment` for a 2 dimensional blob.
- Measure performance benchmarks with [Divan](https://nikolaivazquez.com/blog/divan/)
