This repository is a place where I can document KZG-based concepts used to scale Ethereum.

The **overarching goal** of this repository is to create one of cryptography's key cryptographic primitives: the elliptic curve pairing.  

Pairings introduce a form of "encrypted mulitiplication", allowing us to check quadratic constraints.

TODO: 
- Create `blob_to_kzg_commitment` for a 2 dimensional blob.
- Measure performance benchmarks with [Divan](https://nikolaivazquez.com/blog/divan/)
